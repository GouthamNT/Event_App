                    <p id=sub-heading>HTML 5</p>
                    <p id=description>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and current version of the HTML standard.HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications. For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a potential candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, with features having been designed with low-powered devices such as smartphones and tablets taken into consideration</p>
                    <p id=sub-heading>CSS</p>
                    <p id=description>CSS is a stylesheet language that describes the presentation of an HTML (or XML) document. CSS describes how elements must be rendered on screen, on paper, or in other media. This tutorial will teach you CSS from basic to advanced. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.</p>
                    <p id=sub-heading>Javascript</p>
                    <p id=description>JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the Web. Programming makes computers do what you want them to do. JavaScript is easy to learn.JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern Web browsers without plug-ins. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.</p>
                    <p id=sub-heading>jQuery</p>
                    <p id=description>jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today, with installation on 65% of the top 10 million highest-trafficked sites on the Web. jQuery is free, open-source software licensed under the MIT License. jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.</p>

                    <p id=description>I wanted to acquire Web development skills to complement my mobile UI skills. I was initially a bit scared, but soon found that learning from a mentor is fun. With newfound motivation, I went on to develop two new Android applications</p>
                    <p id=sub-heading>XXXX</p>
                    <p id=description>I enrolled for the Frontend development course at AcadGild. The lectures by the mentors are delivered in such a way that they are easy to understand. I appreciate the mentor's patience and the attention paid to each and every individual.</p>
                    <p id=sub-heading>XXXX</p>
                    <p id=description>I am a 2nd year engineering student, wanted to get an exposure to the latest technologies and build my portfolio. After completing my course, I am earning my pocket money by taking up freelance work on web Development.</p>
                    <p id=sub-heading>XXXX</p>
                    <p id=description>I enrolled for JavaScrpit course at AcadGild. The mentor took the teaching to a different level by individually addressing everyone in the class. He took pains in helping us with our queries in an effective manner. The class is more interactive now and even those students with no programming background are doing fairly well. I am delighted with the experience and knowledge that I am gaining under YYY's mentorship.</p>
